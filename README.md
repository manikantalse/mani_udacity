# Memory Game

## Description

The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

## How the game works

Each turn:

* The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
* The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
* If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
* The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

## What the player can expect from the game

Player is rewarded with 

* 3 stars if he finishes the game within 10 moves
* 2 stars if he finishes the game within 20 moves and
* 1 star if he takes more than 20 moves
